# Project-Based Investments Implementation Plan

## Overview

This document outlines the comprehensive plan for enhancing the existing investments module with project-based functionality. The goal is to allow users to organize their investments around specific financial objectives and projects, providing better goal-oriented tracking and management.

## Current State Analysis

### Existing Infrastructure
The current investments module provides a solid foundation with:
- Individual investment tracking (stocks, bonds, ETF, crypto, etc.)
- Performance analytics and dividend tracking
- Goal setting and risk assessment
- Portfolio allocation and rebalancing features
- Tax reporting capabilities

### Current Database Schema
The existing `investments` table includes:
- Basic investment information (type, symbol, name, quantity)
- Financial data (purchase price, current value, dividends, fees)
- Portfolio management (target allocation, risk tolerance)
- Transaction and tax tracking
- Status management

### Identified Gaps
- No ability to group investments by specific projects or objectives
- Lack of goal-oriented progress tracking
- Missing project-based analytics and reporting
- No multi-project allocation support

## Implementation Plan

### Phase 1: Core Infrastructure

#### 1.1 Create Investment Projects Model

**New Model: `InvestmentProject`**
```php
// Database fields for investment_projects table:
- id (primary key)
- user_id (foreign key to users table)
- name (e.g., "Retirement Fund", "House Down Payment", "Emergency Fund")
- description (detailed project description)
- target_amount (financial goal amount)
- target_date (when the goal should be achieved)
- risk_tolerance (conservative, moderate, aggressive)
- project_type (retirement, emergency, goal-based, education, etc.)
- status (active, completed, paused, cancelled)
- created_at, updated_at (timestamps)
```

#### 1.2 Database Schema Changes

**Migration 1: `create_investment_projects_table.php`**
```php
Schema::create('investment_projects', function (Blueprint $table) {
    $table->id();
    $table->foreignId('user_id')->constrained()->cascadeOnDelete();
    $table->string('name');
    $table->text('description')->nullable();
    $table->decimal('target_amount', 15, 2);
    $table->date('target_date');
    $table->enum('risk_tolerance', ['conservative', 'moderate', 'aggressive'])->default('moderate');
    $table->enum('project_type', ['retirement', 'emergency', 'goal_based', 'education', 'real_estate', 'other'])->default('goal_based');
    $table->enum('status', ['active', 'completed', 'paused', 'cancelled'])->default('active');
    $table->timestamps();
    
    $table->index(['user_id', 'status']);
    $table->index(['target_date']);
});
```

**Migration 2: `add_project_relationship_to_investments_table.php`**
```php
Schema::table('investments', function (Blueprint $table) {
    $table->foreignId('project_id')->nullable()->constrained('investment_projects')->nullOnDelete();
    $table->decimal('project_allocation_percentage', 5, 2)->default(100.00);
    
    $table->index(['project_id']);
});
```

#### 1.3 Model Relationships Enhancement

**Update Investment Model:**
```php
// Add to Investment model
public function project(): BelongsTo
{
    return $this->belongsTo(InvestmentProject::class);
}

// Add project-based scopes
public function scopeByProject($query, $projectId)
{
    return $query->where('project_id', $projectId);
}

public function scopeWithoutProject($query)
{
    return $query->whereNull('project_id');
}

// Add project allocation calculations
public function getProjectAllocationValueAttribute()
{
    return $this->current_market_value * ($this->project_allocation_percentage / 100);
}
```

**Create InvestmentProject Model:**
```php
class InvestmentProject extends Model
{
    protected $fillable = [
        'user_id', 'name', 'description', 'target_amount', 'target_date',
        'risk_tolerance', 'project_type', 'status'
    ];

    protected function casts(): array
    {
        return [
            'target_amount' => 'decimal:2',
            'target_date' => 'date',
        ];
    }

    public function user(): BelongsTo
    {
        return $this->belongsTo(User::class);
    }

    public function investments(): HasMany
    {
        return $this->hasMany(Investment::class);
    }

    // Calculated attributes
    public function getCurrentValueAttribute()
    {
        return $this->investments->sum(function ($investment) {
            return $investment->project_allocation_value;
        });
    }

    public function getProgressPercentageAttribute()
    {
        if ($this->target_amount == 0) return 0;
        return min(($this->current_value / $this->target_amount) * 100, 100);
    }

    public function getDaysRemainingAttribute()
    {
        return now()->diffInDays($this->target_date, false);
    }
}
```

### Phase 2: Basic Project Features

#### 2.1 Project Management Controller

**Create `InvestmentProjectController`:**
```php

    public function update(UpdateInvestmentProjectRequest $request, InvestmentProject $project) // Update project
    public function destroy(InvestmentProject $project) // Delete project
    public function analytics(InvestmentProject $project) // Project-specific analytics
}
```

#### 2.2 Form Request Classes

**Create validation classes:**
- `StoreInvestmentProjectRequest`
- `UpdateInvestmentProjectRequest`

#### 2.3 Investment Assignment Interface

**Update InvestmentController:**
```php
// Add methods for project management
